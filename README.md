WORK IN PROGRESS
Rest API that can Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) documents in MongoDB.

Things I've learned
- Encrypt user passwords with "bcrypt".
- Authenticate users with JSON web token.
- Use middleware for mongoose model and express routes to check if there is a valid token that matches the user's id before saving data.
